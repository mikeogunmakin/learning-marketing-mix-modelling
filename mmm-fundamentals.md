# Fundamentals of MMM

## What are MMMs?

Marketing Mix Models (MMMs) are statistical models used by marketers to measure the impact of various marketing activities (like TV, radio, digital, print, pricing, promotions, etc.) on key business outcomes such as sales, brand awareness, or customer acquisition.

## Why are MMMs important?

Advertisers need to understand the effectiveness of their media spend in driving sales in order to optimise budget allocations.

However, tracking and attribution have become more difficult as privacy concerns have grown. Media mix models are a common and widely used approach for understanding marketing effectiveness without compromising user privacy.
