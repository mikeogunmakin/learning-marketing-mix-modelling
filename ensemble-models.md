# XG Boost

- Based on gradient boosted decision trees
- Gradient Boosted Trees â€“ Decision Trees trained sequentially, where each new tree learns to correct the errors of the previous one. The final prediction is a weighted sum of all trees.
- Thus it is an ensemble model
- Ensemble models are machine learning models that combine multiple individual models (called base learners or weak learners) to make better predictions than any single model alone.
